# Citizen Reports

### Quick Start

Check out the Google Firebase quick start documentation here: [https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)

## Features

Citizen reports is a real time reporting tool which automatically geolocates reports sent by citizens when a newsworthy incident occurs. 

It includes a built-in image compression tool which allows users to quickly upload images to the platform even when mobile internet service is poor. 

For journalists monitoring reports from citizens in the newsroom on their desktop, there is also a notification feature so they never miss a report - even when the browser window is minimized and without the need for a page refresh.
